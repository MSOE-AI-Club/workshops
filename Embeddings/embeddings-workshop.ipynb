    "Beyond that, embeddings are incredibly common in ML, powering everything from search engines and recommendation systems to chatbots and fraud detection.\n",
    "You'll see embeddings being used everywhere if you look! Here are just some models, projects, and papers that make use of embeddings:\n",

    "**What *are* Embeddings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the lowest level, an embedding is just stored as a list of numbers. This could be an embedding: `[0.1, 0.2, -0.3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list of numbers is best interpreted as a point or direction in some very high-dimensional space that represents something. In the case of text-based models, embeddings are used to represent words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, embeddings range from tens of dimensions to over 1000. For simplicity, let's only conceptualize things in two or three dimensions for now - that way we can actually visualize what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows how embedded words can be thought of as directions in space. We're specifically looking at words in the phrase `some embedded text`. Each embedding point describes direction relative to the point (0,0).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSOE-AI-Club/workshops/refs/heads/main/Embeddings/img1.png\" width=1000px>\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we actually interpret these directions in space as being words? The answer is that different directions in the space represent different aspects of a word -\n",
    "- one direction may encode \"past tense,\"\n",
    "- another may enode the idea of \"running\" or \"to run.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case above, the embedding of the word \"ran\" may point in the average of the directions encoding \"past tense,\" and \"to run.\"\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSOE-AI-Club/workshops/refs/heads/main/Embeddings/img2.png\" width=600px>\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic naturally leads into another important point: embeddings *closer* in embedding space are also *closer* in meaning. The word \"ran\" will be closer to \"walked\" than to \"stapler.\" This is the case, because words with increasingly different meanings are, *by definition,* pointing in increasingly different directions to encode those meanings.\n",

    "If directions can be allocated to specific ideas like \"WWII Axis leaders,\" how are there enough directions left to represent everything else, from \"60s British pop bands\" to \"computer keyboard layouts\"?!?!\n",

    "In two or three dimensions, it's *not* really possible to have directions this specific. But, remember that text embeddings are typically 10s to 1000s of dimensions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of dimensions grows, the number of possible points and directions in a space grows MUCH more quickly. More directions means more unique aspects of a word can be encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work with the constraint that points of different meanings must be one unit apart. This is somewhat arbitrary, but it is true that there is a \"minumum\" distance between two points before they mean the same thing. Let's also say that we only allow points in the range 0 to 1. This is also somewhat arbitrary, but machine learning models often try to keep numbers from getting too big to prevent numbers from going to infinity. With these constraints, we can only fit two points in one dimension:\n",

    "\n",
    "And if we went to three dimensions we'd have eight points - imagine extruding the four points of this square into a cube.\n",

    "- With 10 dimensions, you have over 1000 directions.\n",
    "- 20 dimensions gets us over 1 million directions.\n",

    "**Q: How would you normally measure distance between points in space?**\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, you *could* use Euclidean distance for embeddings, but we use a different distance metric to take advantage of the fact that embeddings are directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a metric you can compute between two vectors (two directions) called the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) of the two vectors. This number is simply the cosine of the angle between the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSOE-AI-Club/workshops/refs/heads/main/Embeddings/img6.png\" width=1000px>\n",
    "\n",
    "If an angle $\\theta$ between two vectors is small and close to zero, then the cosine of that value will be close to $\\cos(0) = 1$. The maximum cosine similarity is $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the angle increases, the cosine similarity decreases. When the angle passes ninety degrees, the cosine similarity goes negative. Two opposite vectors have a cosine similarity of $-1$. **Higher cosine similarity means two vectors are more similar.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The cosine similarity is so useful not only because it can tell us the similarity between vectors, but *also* because it's really easy to calculate. Simply multiply each number in a vector with each number in the same position in another, and then take the sum:\n",
    "$$\\text{CosineSim}([1,2], [3,4]) = 1\\times2\\ +\\ 2\\times4.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantity is also called the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product), and we'll be computing it via `np.dot`.\n",
    "\n",
    "DISCLAIMER: technically, the dot product only equals the cosine similarity when the vectors are *normalized* (have a magnitude of 1), but embedding vectors are usually normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a separate metric from cosine similarity called cosine *distance.* It is computed via $1 - \\text{CosineSim}$. Unlike cosine similarity which tells you \"how similar\" two vectors are, cosine distance acts more like Euclidean distance in the sense that higher numbers mean \"more different\" rather than \"more similar.\" The cosine distance ranges from $0$ (for two equal vectors) to $2$ (for two opposite vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you *did* use Euclidean distance on embeddings, your distances would be similar to those from using cosine distance. The reason that cosine distance is still preferred is computational - the Euclidean distance requires a square root to compute while cosine distance doesn't.\n",

    "In general, if your task doesn't span the entirety of natural language, you can perform *dimensionality reduction*! There are [many ways to reduce the number of dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), but we'll focus on the relatively simple (yet powerful) method referred to as PCA.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSOE-AI-Club/workshops/refs/heads/main/Embeddings/img7.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this, it seems we don't really *need* two dimensions to describe all of our jobs. We can just use a single number to say how far they are along a line. In other words: **one dimension explains 100% of the variance in our data.**\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, PCA asks \"what direction most strongly differentiates some datapoints,\" and then it asks \"what directions is *second best* at differentiating points\" and so on.\n",
