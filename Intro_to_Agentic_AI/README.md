(Rosie is not needed!)

Prereqs:
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Ensure you can run notebooks in VSCode.
- **For MCP servers (optional):** Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) so you can run servers like `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` or `server-github`.

> IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are participating on the day of the workshop (2/12/26), do NOT clone this notebook. We will provide a different one day-of with keys for you to use.

**What are AI Agents?**

As defined by Google, an AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt.​

Their capabilities are made possible in large part by the multimodal capacity of generative AI and AI foundation models. AI agents can process multimodal information like text, voice, video, audio, code, and more simultaneously; can converse, reason, learn, and make decisions. They can learn over time and facilitate transactions and business processes. Agents can work with other agents to coordinate and perform more complex workflows.

**That's cool. How do I make my own agent?**
